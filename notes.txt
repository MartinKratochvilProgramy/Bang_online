create funsctions that set isPlayable true/false for card typep for layer
-> setPlayable(cardName, playerName)
-> setNotPlayable(cardName, playerName)
-> setAllPlayable(playerName)
-> setAllNotPlayable(playerName)

then on actions use said funsctions
-> Bang! A to B => setPlayable(Mancato!, B)
-> B plays Mancato! -> setAllNotPlayable(Mancato!, B)

endTurn() 
-> setAllNotPlayable(A)
-> setAllPlayable(B)
